  const { data, isLoading, error } = useShape({
    url: `${electricUrl}/v1/shape`,
    params: {
      table: 'companies',
      // Filter by user's memberships
    }
  })
  
  return { companies: data, isLoading, error }
}

// composables/useSyncedMembers.ts
export function useSyncedMembers(companyId: string) {
  // Sync company members in real-time
  const { data } = useShape({
    url: `${electricUrl}/v1/shape`,
    params: {
      table: 'company_members',
      where: `company_id = '${companyId}'`
    }
  })
  
  return { members: data }
}
```
